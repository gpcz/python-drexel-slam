I mainly wrote this code to learn how to implement Simultaneous Localization And 
Mapping (SLAM) using Extended Kalman Filters, and I only put it online in case
someone else could benefit from what was a quick pet project of mine.

It's basically a direct port of the Homework 4 Matlab code written by Drexel
University at http://prism2.mem.drexel.edu/~billgreen/slam/slam.html , and 
there are now way better algorithms for solving the SLAM problem than 
Extended Kalman Filters, so I place this Python code in the public domain.

If you want to learn modern SLAM, please take Prof. Olson's EECS 568 course
at the University of Michigan or review all the course materials online at
