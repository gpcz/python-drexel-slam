python-drexel-slam
==================

This code implements the final homework from Drexel University's online Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) lectures ( http://prism2.mem.drexel.edu/~billgreen/slam/slam.html ).  It uses an Extended Kalman Filter for implementation, which still has educational value despite not being the current state of the art in SLAM.

Dependencies: Scipy/Matplotlib

To use, download the Matlab code template titled "Matlab template for homework 4" from http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu/~billgreen/slam/slam.html to get copies of beac_juan3.mat and data_set.mat, which are the datasets for this example.  Copy them to the same folder as this repository and run slam.py.
